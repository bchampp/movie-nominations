# Movie Nomination App
This repository contains my implementation for the Spotify Summer 2021 Intern Challenge.
Live deployment of the project can be found <a href="https://shoppy-movies.netlify.app/">here!</a>

## Implementation
The implementation for the project can be found inside the `src` folder, which contains index.tsx & App.tsx, `components` which contains all the react components I implemented, `constants` for constants that are used throughout the project and `models` for the models for data flow. 

I chose to implement this in TypeScript since I use TS for my work already, and don't have much experience writing react components in TS.
